                <p>Status Report</p>
                
                <p>My understandings about CSS page layouts<br>
                <strong>Padding and Margin</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Padding is for creating space between an element and a border that surrounds the element while margin is for creating space outside the border.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Block and inline elements</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;block element starts with a new line and takes the full length of width. For example, we can specify the CSS of an element to be "display: block;" to take the entire width and start in a new line.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inline elements don't take more space than the width of the element and don't start in a new line &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Position: </strong>for positioning an element. There are 4 types, static, fixed, absolute, relative. The default is static and relative is the same as static unless we specify top, left, right, bottom properties.&nbsp;<br>
                <strong>Floats and Clear</strong>: float is for positioning an element to left or right and clear is to specify that an element to move below a floating element. &nbsp;we must also specify the width of a floating element not to take up the entire width.&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p>* I have difficulties understanding about flex responsive layout properties<br>
                &nbsp;</p>
